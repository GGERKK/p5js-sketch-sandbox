# p5js-sketches
This is where I store my psj5 sketches. These sketches are for my own practice and may be downloaded and used for personal or professional work. I only ask that you iterate on the original, push it in some new direction, give it meaning and share it back with me by using the hashtag #p5js_GGERKK or creating a branch.
